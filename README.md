# Data
* The dataset which contains imitated data of employees attrition of some company.

# Main task
* Create a model for predicting employee attrition.

# The subtasks was 
* EDA;
* Dependances visualization and analysis;
* Model training whit accuracy > 88%.

# File description
> In main directory
* Employee_Attrition_Prediction.ipynb  - contains all data preprocessing and modeling code;
* Analysis&Visualization.ipynb - contains analysis of dependances, outlier checking and distribution graphs;
* Modelin_Results_Visualization.ipynb - contains visualization of the modeling results;
* CatBoost_Pipeline.py - A script with pipline for final model.

> In modules
* encoding.py - OHE application script;
* load_data.py - data loader function script;
* modeling.py - script of setting and training the models;
* outliers.py - outlier handling script.

> In data
